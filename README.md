# final_project

Most of the datasets used exceed the Github file size limit (100MB). Therefore they cannot be included in this repository. 

To reproduce our work please download and save the following files in a folder named "data" in your own R env.  

# 1. UK real estate transactions

Note that this is the complete dataset (1995-2022) and it is particularly heavy (28M observations / ~4.7Go)
